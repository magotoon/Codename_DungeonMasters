# Codename_DungeonMasters
 Beta build of a board game with a reaction based boss fight created using Java and JavaFX (Scene Builder)

Project made using Eclipse and Scene View, the project runs fine from the IDE but still has some bugs with 
the images once it's exported into a .jar file.

to view/edit the project just import into eclipse, and install the javaFX extension to Eclipse.
